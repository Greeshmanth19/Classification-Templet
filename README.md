Classification Models using Machine Learning
This repository contains a code template that allows you to implement various classification models for different datasets using machine learning algorithms. By leveraging this template, you can easily experiment with and compare the performance of multiple classification models, empowering you to make informed decisions about which model to choose for your specific classification task.

Installation:
To use this code template locally, follow these steps:
Clone the repository:

HTTP link -> git clone https://github.com/Greeshmanth19/Classification-Templet.git

Install the required dependencies:

command -> pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage:
To implement classification models using this code template, follow these steps:

Prepare your dataset in a compatible format (e.g., CSV, Excel, or any other supported format).
Open the classification_templet.py.
Load your dataset into the notebook and preprocess the data as needed.
Select the classification model you wish to use from the available options.
Train the model on your dataset and evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics.
Optionally, you can tweak hyperparameters, try different feature engineering techniques, or experiment with other preprocessing methods to improve model performance.

Supported Classification Models:

This code template provides implementations for the following classification models:

Logistic Regression
Naive Bayes
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Feel free to explore each model's implementation and customize them according to your requirements.
